# Heart-Disease-Classification-Using-Personal-Key-Indicators

(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease), 
we were interested how people could self-test whether they are potential to have heart disease 
by asking some personal questions such as “do you drink alcohol”, “do you ever have stroke”, “do you feel difficult in walking” etc .
